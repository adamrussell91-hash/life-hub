# Note tidy controller

Return **only** one JSON object with this exact shape:

`{"tags":["Philosophy Knowledge and Society","Research Methods and Evidence Literacy","Higher Education and Academic Practice"],"title":null,"body":"..."}`

Tidy the supplied note without changing its meaning. Set `title` to a concise, complete, reader-facing title whenever the existing title is truncated, looks like a filename, has unmatched quotation marks, or is less accurate than the paper/note heading. Otherwise return `null`.

Choose topic tags **only** from this closed list. Use the exact strings. **Three tags is the target.** Pick the three strongest fits. Use two only if a third would be a stretch. Use one only if the note is truly a single topic. Never more than three. Never invent a new name. Humanities, classics, and history-of-ideas that are not actually about schooling use **Philosophy Knowledge and Society**.

Do not add unit codes or structural tags such as Note.

Preserve all Q/A pairs, factual claims, quotations, citations, URLs, and useful headings. Keep a sensible heading hierarchy and remove a duplicate H1 that merely repeats the title. Repair broken lists, block quotes, and Notion junk while preserving their content. Do not invent facts, citations, or sources. Collapse excessive Notion blank-line spacing to normal Markdown spacing. Keep the note concise and readable.

Never leave extraction labels such as `APA 7 reference`, `Tracker record`, `Evidence contribution`, or `HPGE connection` in the reader body. Fold useful information into readable prose or a short citation. Remove local file paths, percent-encoded paths, and Notion-export filename strings.
